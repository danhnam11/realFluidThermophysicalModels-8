GENERATE THE PROPERTIES OF SPECIES-by Danh Nam
- Noted that you can generate properties of any species involved in thermo.compessible_realGas dictionary file
- Temperature is set from 100-2500K. As a result, you can get thermodynamic and transport data from 100-2500K.

Procedure:
  1. Specifies species name that you want to generate its properties at "species" entry in /constant/reactions file.
  2. Changes the name of inert species into the species's name that you want to generate properties at "inertSpecie" entry in the thermophysicalProperties dictionary file in constant/ directory.
  2. Changes the species dictionary file in time "0" directory into the name of species that you want to generate its properties.
  3. Changes the pressure in "p" dicitonary file in time "0" directory into pressure that you want to extract.
  4. types "realFluidReactingFoam" to run realFluidReactingFoam solver.
  5. after finish, types "./postProcessing dummy_name outputFile_name.dat" to generate data for tecplot format.
  6. copy the following content into 1st line of the "outputFile_name.dat" generated at step 5.

variables =
T(K) p(atm) rho(kg/m^3) mu(kg/m-s) kappa(W/m-K) Cv(J/kg-K) Cp(J/kg-K) HE(J/kg)   

  7. Now the outputFile_name.dat is ready to be used in tecplot.
